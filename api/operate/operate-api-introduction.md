## Introduction

Operate API is a REST API and provides searching, getting, and changing Operate data.
Requests and responses are in JSON notation. Some objects have additional endpoints.
For example, `process-definitions` has an endpoint to get the process-definition as XML representation.
In case of errors, Operate API returns an error object.
